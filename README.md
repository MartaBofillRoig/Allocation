Optimal allocation in platform trials
================

This repository contains the main code to reproduce the results of the
paper “Optimal allocations in platform trials” by Marta Bofill Roig,
Ekkehard Glimm, Tobias Mielke, and Martin Posch.

In particular, the following scripts are included in this repository:

-   **case3_b\_lagrange.nb**: Computations on case 3 with Lagrange
    Multipliers. Three-period trial design assuming fixed sample sizes
    in period 1 and 2
-   **case2_ncc.nb**: Computations on case 2 using non-concurrent
    controls. Two-period trial design assuming fixed sample sizes in
    period 1 and 2.
-   **case2_lagrange_ncc.nb**: Computations on case 2 using
    non-concurrent controls with Lagrange Multipliers. Two-period trial
    design assuming fixed sample sizes in period 1 and 2, assuming equal
    allocations in period 1 (that is, r01=r11).

Furthermore,

-   The folder *Slides* contains the code to obtain the plots used for
    the presentation at the Conference of the Spanish Region of the
    International Biometric Society.
