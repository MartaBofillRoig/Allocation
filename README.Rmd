This repository contains the main code to reproduce the results of the paper "Optimal allocations in platform trials" by Marta Bofill Roig, Ekkehard Glimm, Tobias Mielke, and Martin Posch.

In particular, the following scripts are included in this repository:

- **case3_b_lagrange.nb**: Computations on case 3  with Lagrange Multipliers. Three-period trial design assuming fixed sample sizes in period 1 and 2
- **case3_b_lagrange_ncc.nb**: Computations on case 2 using non-concurrent controls. Two-period trial design assuming fixed sample sizes in period 1 and 2.


Furthermore,

- The folder *Slides* contains the code to obtain the plots used for the presentation at the Conference of the Spanish Region of the International Biometric Society.
